						<p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>

						<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. You don't believe in the Force, do you? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I call it luck. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
